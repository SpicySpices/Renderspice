## What Can Renderspice Make?
Even though its niche is game creation, Renderspice can also be used to create designs and displays without having to mess with canvas context. In fact, the background for this website was created in only 17 lines because of Renderspice.

## Why Use Renderspice?
Renderspice is a simple tool that when used to its full extent, can create a very efficient and fast project. The main goal of Renderspice is to cut down the difficulty of using the HTML5 canvas by having a particular focus on game development.

## Future of Renderspice
